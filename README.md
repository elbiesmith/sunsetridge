An array of mountains is facing the sun. The heights of each mountain from West to East is 
given in an integer array. You have to tell which mountain will be able to see the sunset. Write a program that prints 
how many mountains and which mountains will be able to see the Sunset given the Array [3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 9].
